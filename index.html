      Consider donating your spare computer power to research against COVID-19
    </h1>

    <p>
      <a href="https://foldingathome.org">Folding@home</a> and
      <a href="https://boinc.bakerlab.org">Rosetta@home</a> are programs to
      supply scientist the computer power needed to find new cures, they changed
      their focus to the recent COVID-19 virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      These projects aim to simulate how proteins fold (to function) and predict
      their structure in order to study how the virus acts and design
      therapeutics to stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      These molecular simulations are expensive to compute, that&#39;s why any
      contribution helps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://boinc.bakerlab.org">Rosetta@home</a> was recently used to
      accurately predict the atomic-scale structure of an important coronavirus
      protein weeks before it could be measured in the lab.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your computer will run these simulations over long periods of time, both
      using your CPU and GPU, which will consume electricity and produce heat as
      if you were playing video-games.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can throttle how much power is used and whether it should work when
      you are actively using your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you&#39;re currently heating your household, you should pre-emptively
      lower the target temperature by a few degrees and keep the door to the
      room containing the computer open.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
    <p>Be well, stay safe, stay@home.</p>

    <h1 id="update-1">Fellow folders,</h1>
    <p>
      I am pleased to announce our
      <a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/250927"
        >Folding@home MOONMOON community team</a
      >
      reached rank 8650 (out of over 243000). I&#39;d like to thank the wide
      adoption from #tech_talk and I hope to see more sub-communities join in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other good news, the
      <a href="https://foldingathome.org">Folding@home</a> project announced
      that, thanks to people like you, they broke the exaFLOP barrier
      (1,000,000,000,000,000,000 operations per second), which represents more
      computing power than the top 100 supercomputers in the world combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their infrastructure seems to have grown to support a lot more
      contributors too, you should be able to find work units more frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://boinc.bakerlab.org">Rosetta@home</a> project
      announced that their contributor count doubled since late February.
      I&#39;d like to point more attention to that project, as hundreds of
      thousands of CPU work units remain available, hosted by the very sturdy
      BOINC platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;m confident that we will greatly help researchers find solutions
      against COVID-19.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our next steps include publishing the guide on a website that&#39;s easy
      to share and visit, in order to have it linked in the #news channel, and
      hopefully mentioned by moonmoon directly during his broadcast. I&#39;d
      like to thank Brie&#39;s collaboration in this endeavour.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you all for contributing.</p>
    <p>Be well, stay safe, stay@home.</p>
